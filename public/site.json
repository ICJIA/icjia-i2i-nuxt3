The i2i team will help organizations strengthen infrastructure, increase sustainability, and address capacity needs. Cohort members will include local organizations that have yet to receive funding from the state of Illinois and ICJIA grantees with capacity constraints.\n\nThroughout the State of Illinois, thousands of organizations work directly with communities and individuals while struggling with capacity. Historical disinvestment continues to plague “grassroots” organizations, leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving. These groups will benefit from additional support to address their fundamental challenges and organizational needs.\n\ni2i supports “grassroots” organizations and community groups committed to changing the circumstance of violence in their communities. i2i will be a resource for these partners to ensure that their capacity is increased and assist them on a path to sustainability.\n\n</div>\n\n<div  style=\"background: #f1f1f1 !important; color: #000!important; border-top: 1px solid #ddd;\" class=\"py-12\" id=\"services\">\n\n<div class=\"v-container v-container--fluid\">\n\n<div class=\"v-row\">\n\n<div class=\"v-col-md-6 v-col-12\">\n\n## Capacity-Building Services\n\nCapacity-Building Services Include:\n\n- Organizational Development\n\n- Board Development\n\n- Program Assessment & Evaluation\n\n- Refinement of program models and development of logic models\n\n- Personnel/Staffing Support\n\n- Fiscal Management/Oversight\n\n- Grant Administration Skills\n\n- Network Building\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"v-col-md-6 v-col-12\">\n\n## PARLOR: An evidence-informed approach\n\nThe **PARLOR Process** is an evidenced-informed approach designed to address the comprehensive needs of organizations.
