The i2i staff will help organizations strengthen infrastructure, increase sustainability, and address capacity needs. Cohort members will include local organizations that have yet to receive funding from the state of Illinois and ICJIA grantees with capacity constraints.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits has developed this comprehensive definition of nonprofit capacity building: “Capacity building is whatever is needed to bring a nonprofit to the next level of operational, programmatic, financial, or organizational maturity, so it may more effectively and efficiently advance its mission into the future. Capacity building is not a one-time effort to improve short-term effectiveness, but a continuous improvement strategy toward the creation of a sustainable and effective organization.”\n\nCapacity building often gets overlooked or postponed in an organization’s drive to produce visible results. But this is a mistake, says the National Council of Nonprofits. “Capacity building is an investment in the effectiveness and future sustainability of a nonprofit,” the council says. “It strengthens a nonprofit’s ability to fulfill its mission over time, thereby enhancing the nonprofit’s ability to have a positive impact on lives and communities.”\n\ni2i will provide support to “grassroots” organizations and community groups by strengthening their capacity in the following dimensions: \n\n### Capacity-Building Services: \n\n•\tVision and Impact\n\n•\tGovernance and leadership\n\n•\tProgram delivery\n\n•\tResource generation\n\n•\tInternal operations and management\n\n•\tEvaluation and learning\n\n•\tStrategic relationships\n\n\n## Program History (Challenge)\n \nThroughout the State of Illinois, thousands of organizations work directly with communities and individuals while struggling with capacity. Historical disinvestment continues to plague “grassroots” organizations, leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving. These groups will benefit from additional support to address their fundamental challenges and organizational needs.\n\n\n\n","section":"root","createdAt":"2022-12-06T17:39:17.825Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-28T14:50:32.715Z","publishedAt":"2022-12-06T17:39:21.149Z","searchMeta":"icjia grassroots i2i ","rawText":" program overview the illinois criminal justice information authority icjia is launching a new capacity building hub for statewide community based organizations entitled institute 2 innovate i2i the i2i staff will help organizations strengthen infrastructure increase sustainability and address capacity needs cohort members will include local organizations that have yet to receive funding from the state of illinois and icjia grantees with capacity constraints the national council of nonprofits has developed this comprehensive definition of nonprofit capacity building capacity building is whatever is needed to bring a nonprofit to the next level of operational programmatic financial or organizational maturity so it may more effectively and efficiently advance its mission into the future capacity building is not a one time effort to improve short term effectiveness but a continuous improvement strategy toward the creation of a sustainable and effective organization capacity building often gets overlooked or postponed in an organization s drive to produce visible results but this is a mistake says the national council of nonprofits capacity building is an investment in the effectiveness and future sustainability of a nonprofit the council says it strengthens a nonprofit s ability to fulfill its mission over time thereby enhancing the nonprofit s ability to have a positive impact on lives and communities i2i will provide support to grassroots organizations and community groups by strengthening their capacity in the following dimensions capacity building services vision and impact governance and leadership program delivery resource generation internal operations and management evaluation and learning strategic relationships program history challenge throughout the state of illinois thousands of organizations work directly with communities and individuals while struggling with capacity historical disinvestment continues to plague grassroots organizations leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving these groups will benefit from additional support to address their fundamental challenges and organizational needs ","draft":false,"navigation":true,"path":"/about","url":"https://i2i.icjia.dev/about","id":"3","uuid":"f80ccb69-4320-4ef0-87fa-fef8f49e2667"},{"title":"Contact","slug":"contact","hideFromSearch":false,"hideFromSitemap":false,"showTableOfContents":false,"summary":"This is the summary for the contact page.
