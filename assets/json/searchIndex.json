The i2i staff will help organizations strengthen infrastructure, increase sustainability, and address capacity needs. Cohort members will include local organizations that have yet to receive funding from the state of Illinois and ICJIA grantees with capacity constraints. \n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits has developed this comprehensive definition of nonprofit capacity building: “Capacity building is whatever is needed to bring a nonprofit to the next level of operational, programmatic, financial, or organizational maturity, so it may more effectively and efficiently advance its mission into the future. Capacity building is not a one-time effort to improve short-term effectiveness, but a continuous improvement strategy toward the creation of a sustainable and effective organization.” \n\nCapacity building often gets overlooked or postponed in an organization’s drive to produce visible results. But this is a mistake, says the National Council of Nonprofits. “Capacity building is an investment in the effectiveness and future sustainability of a nonprofit,” the council says. “It strengthens a nonprofit’s ability to fulfill its mission over time, thereby enhancing the nonprofit’s ability to have a positive impact on lives and communities.” \n\ni2i will provide support to “grassroots” organizations and community groups by strengthening their capacity in the following dimensions:  \n\n## Capacity-Building Services\n\n- Vision and Impact \n\n- Governance and leadership \n\n- Program delivery \n\n- Resource generation \n\n- Internal operations and management \n\n- Evaluation and learning \n\n- Strategic relationships \n\n## Program History  \n\nThroughout the State of Illinois, thousands of organizations work directly with communities and individuals while struggling with capacity. Historical disinvestment continues to plague “grassroots” organizations, leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving. These groups will benefit from additional support to address their fundamental challenges and organizational needs. \n\ni2i supports “grassroots” organizations and community groups committed to changing the circumstance of violence in their communities. i2i will be a resource for these partners to ensure that their capacity is increased and assist them on a path to sustainability. \n\n## Program Approach  \n\nThe **PARLOR** Process is an evidenced-informed approach designed to address the comprehensive needs of organizations. Therefore, each PARLOR step will address specific to strengthen the organization's infrastructure.  \n\n- Planning – Develop a mission, vision, and strategic plan \n\n- Administration – Establish board and executive staff \n\n- Resources – Create proven fiscal management and financial standards \n\n- Learning – Assess human capital/staff needs \n\n- Optimization – Develop protocols that assess effectiveness and program outcomes \n\n- Relationships – Expand external networks and connect with new partners \n\n## Program Organizations  \n\nThe participating organizations will receive training (i.e., webinars, workshops, in-person consultation, etc.) on various topics to strengthen their organization's infrastructure. \n\n- CHM Bible Theatre Productions, Inc. \n\n- Equiticity \n\n- Metro

As a result, thousands of small organizations throughout Illinois struggle with capacity as they work to make a positive impact by providing much-needed community services.  \n\nTo ensure smaller organizations have the tools to manage their grants and create sustainable programs, ICJIA has developed the i2i capacity-building hub that will expand technical assistance programming for grassroots organizations and community groups committed to changing the circumstances of violence in their communities.  \n\nThe i2i program and curriculum will be a resource for potential partners who need help with operational infrastructure and capacity.  i2i staff will offer capacity-building service support for up to 18 months.  \n\nEquity, fairness, and opportunity across Illinois are overarching priorities for every grant program ICJIA administers.  The i2i initiative will ensure that, upon program completion, the program participants are viable and sustainable organizations that impact communities.   \n\nRespectfully, \n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Delrice Adams</strong><br/>\n<strong>Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, Executive Director</strong>\n\n\n</div>\n","section":"root","createdAt":"2022-12-06T17:40:55.485Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-12T13:56:40.330Z","publishedAt":"2022-12-06T17:42:48.426Z","searchMeta":null,"rawText":" home boxes welcome message nbsp i am excited to announce illinois criminal justice information authority s icjia new institute 2 innovate i2i program this initiative is a capacity building program that will provide group and one on one coaching to grassroots organizations historical disinvestment continues to plague grassroots organizations leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving as a result thousands of small organizations throughout illinois struggle with capacity as they work to make a positive impact by providing much needed community services to ensure smaller organizations have the tools to manage their grants and create sustainable programs icjia has developed the i2i capacity building hub that will expand technical assistance programming for grassroots organizations and community groups committed to changing the circumstances of violence in their communities the i2i program and curriculum will be a resource for potential partners who need help with operational infrastructure and capacity i2i staff will offer capacity building service support for up to 18 months equity fairness and opportunity across illinois are overarching priorities for every grant program icjia administers the i2i initiative will ensure that upon program completion the program participants are viable and sustainable organizations that impact communities respectfully delrice adams illinois criminal justice information authority executive director ","draft":false,"navigation":true,"path":"/","url":"https://i2i.illinois.gov","id":"5","uuid":"c8f05931-d091-40ff-99d4-b695311f4244"},{"title":"State of Illinois Privacy Policy","slug":"privacy","hideFromSearch":false,"hideFromSitemap":false,"showTableOfContents":true,"summary":"Access to the State of Illinois websites is provided subject to the following terms and conditions.
