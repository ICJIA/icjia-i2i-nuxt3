I am excited to announce Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority's (ICJIA) new Institute 2 Innovate (i2i) program.  This initiative is a capacity-building program that will provide group and one-on-one coaching to grassroots organizations.  

Historical disinvestment continues to plague grassroots organizations, leaving them vulnerable and at risk of dissolving.  As a result, thousands of small organizations throughout Illinois struggle with capacity as they work to make a positive impact by providing much-needed community services.  

To ensure smaller organizations have the tools to manage their grants and create sustainable programs, ICJIA has developed the i2i capacity-building hub that will expand technical assistance programming for grassroots organizations and community groups committed to changing the circumstances of violence in their communities.  

The i2i program and curriculum will be a resource for potential partners who need help with operational infrastructure and capacity.  i2i staff will offer capacity-building service support for up to 18 months.  

Equity, fairness, and opportunity across Illinois are overarching priorities for every grant program ICJIA administers.  The i2i initiative will ensure that, upon program completion, the program participants are viable and sustainable organizations that impact communities.   

Respectfully,
